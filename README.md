### **Case Study: Timer Development for FIS Global Instructional Developer Practical Test**

#### **Project Overview:**
For this assignment, I was tasked with demonstrating my intermediate to advanced Articulate Storyline 360 skills by developing three unique countdown timers. The challenge was to build three different timer countdowns, each using a distinct method in Storyline 360. The timers had to be visually interactive, functional, and include specific requirements such as a reset function, UX/UI design, and a lightbox for the "TIME'S UP!" message.

### **Objectives:**
- **Create Three Countdown Timers**: Each timer must count down from 10 seconds to 0 seconds and be developed using different Storyline methods.
- **User Interface (UI)**: The UX/UI must feature a clock/timer graphic of choice and include instructions on what the user needs to do.
- **Interactivity**: Each timer should only begin when the user clicks a button in the UI.
- **Completion**: Upon reaching 0 seconds, a lightbox should pop up with the message "TIMES UP!" and a RESET TIMER button.
- **Reset Functionality**: The timer should reset to 10 seconds upon clicking the RESET TIMER button.

### **Approach & Methodology:**

1. **Timer 1 – Basic Timer Using Variables:**
   - **Objective**: Implement a simple countdown using variables to track the timer's countdown from 10 seconds.
   - **UX/UI Design**: A simple clock graphic was used, with the countdown displayed inside the clock.
   - **Storyline Development Method**: 
     - **Variables** were created to track the time remaining (10 seconds).
     - A button was used to trigger the countdown, which started when clicked.
     - A lightbox triggered when the timer hit 0, displaying the "TIMES UP!" message.
     - A RESET TIMER button was displayed after the lightbox closed, which reset the timer when clicked.
   - **Challenges**: Ensuring the timer was smooth and synchronized with the graphics.

2. **Timer 2 – Using Triggers and Animation:**
   - **Objective**: Implement the countdown using triggers and animation, rather than just variables.
   - **UX/UI Design**: A different clock design was used, incorporating a radial timer effect that visually shows the countdown.
   - **Storyline Development Method**: 
     - Animations were used to make the timer tick down visually, in sync with the countdown.
     - Triggers were set up to decrease the timer's value when the user clicked the start button.
     - The lightbox appeared once the animation reached the end of the countdown, and the "TIMES UP!" message was shown.
     - A RESET TIMER button was triggered once the lightbox was closed.
   - **Challenges**: Synchronizing the animation with the exact timing of the countdown and ensuring smooth transitions.

3. **Timer 3 – Using JavaScript for Precision:**
   - **Objective**: Use JavaScript to create a more precise countdown timer.
   - **UX/UI Design**: A more complex clock graphic was used, incorporating numbers and a digital timer look.
   - **Storyline Development Method**: 
     - **JavaScript** was used for a more accurate countdown, starting at 10 seconds when the user clicked the start button.
     - The timer decreased every second using JavaScript commands, and the countdown was visually represented with text on the clock.
     - A lightbox triggered at 0 seconds, displaying the "TIMES UP!" message.
     - A RESET TIMER button was displayed after the lightbox closed, which reset the clock and cleared the JavaScript variables when clicked.
   - **Challenges**: Ensuring the JavaScript function worked correctly across various platforms and browsers.

### **Key Features and Functionalities:**
- **UX/UI Design**: Each timer scene contained a clear button to start the countdown, a graphic clock/timer, and visible instructions.
- **Interactive Elements**:
   - Countdown timers activated only when the user clicked the start button.
   - The lightbox pop-up with the "TIMES UP!" message was triggered when the countdown reached zero.
   - The RESET TIMER button appeared after closing the lightbox, allowing the user to reset the timer to 10 seconds.
   - The interaction was seamless, with no lags or errors during the flow.
   
- **User Instructions**: Simple and direct instructions were provided within the UI:
   - “Click the start button to begin the countdown.”
   - “Once the timer hits 0, a lightbox will appear with the message ‘TIME’S UP!’.”
   - “Click the RESET TIMER button to reset the clock.”

### **Technologies and Tools Used:**
- **Articulate Storyline 360**: For course development, animation, interactivity, and timeline management.
- **JavaScript**: To implement the precise countdown in Timer 3.
- **Lightbox**: For displaying the "TIME'S UP!" message upon reaching 0 seconds.

---

### **Outcome & Results:**
- All three timers met the project requirements and were fully functional.
- The timers demonstrated a clear progression from basic variable use to advanced JavaScript implementation.
- The design was user-friendly, with easy navigation between each timer, clear instructions, and an intuitive layout.
- The reset function worked seamlessly, and all interactions were smooth, providing a rich learning experience for users.

### **Conclusion:**
This project provided a comprehensive demonstration of my abilities in Articulate Storyline 360, ranging from basic functionality with variables to more complex implementations using JavaScript. By creating three distinct countdown timers, I was able to showcase my skillset in interactive learning design, ensuring that each timer provided a unique user experience while fulfilling the project requirements.
